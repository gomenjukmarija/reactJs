// You are looking at an rendered <GuineaPigs /> component.
// <GuineaPigs />'s job is to render a photo carousel of guinea pigs.
// It does this perfectly well! And yet, it has a problem: it does too much stuff.
// We can break <GuineaPigs /> into smaller components, but before we do:
// how do we know that GuineaPigs does too much stuff?
// How can you tell when a component has too many responsibilities?
// Separating container components from presentational components helps to answer that question.
// It shows you when it might be a good time to divide a component into smaller components.
// It also shows you how to perform that division.
